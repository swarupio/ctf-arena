# Mini CTF Arena

A small Capture-The-Flag platform built for our Cloud Computing (CC) project.
Players log in with **MFA**, join a team, start a **Docker container per challenge**,
submit flags, and climb a **live leaderboard**. Everything runs in the cloud.

**Team (build order):** Swarup -> Gururaj -> Shubham

---

## The four cloud services (project requirement)

| # | Cloud service | Tool we use | Where it shows up on the website |
|---|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | IAM + MFA | AWS Cognito (TOTP authenticator app) | Sign up, login, 6-digit code, `player` / `admin` roles |
| 2 | Database as a Service | MongoDB Atlas (free tier) | Teams, challenges, solves, submissions, leaderboard |
| 3 | Docker + scaling | Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx | One container per team per challenge, 3 backend replicas |
| 4 | Deployment | AWS EC2 + GitHub Actions | Public URL, auto-deploy on push to `main` |

## Who builds what

| Phase | Owner | Part of the website | Ends with tag |
|-------|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Swarup** | Foundation: repo, IAM + MFA login, teams, database, frontend shell | `v0.1-foundation` |
| 2 | **Gururaj** | Challenges, Docker engine, flag submission, scoring | `v0.2-engine` |
| 3 | **Shubham** | Leaderboard, admin dashboard, scaling, deployment, demo, report | `v1.0-release` |

## Read the docs in this order

1. `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` - what we are building and why
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - how the pieces fit together
3. `docs/WORKFLOW.md` - **how we hand work from one person to the next**
4. `docs/TASKS.md` - the exact task list for each person
5. `AGENTS.md` - instructions for AI coding agents (Codex CLI, Claude Code, etc.)
6. `docs/API_SPEC.md` and `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - the contracts everyone codes against
7. `docs/CHALLENGES.md` - the starter challenges and the container template
8. `docs/SETUP.md` - local setup, Atlas, Cognito
9. `docs/SECURITY.md` - rules that keep the platform safe
10. `docs/DEMO_AND_REPORT.md` - demo script and report outline

## Backend skeleton (P1-01 through P1-03)

Use Node.js 20 or later. From the repository root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cd backend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

On PowerShell use `Copy-Item .env.example .env` instead of `cp`.
The backend loads the root `.env` regardless of the working directory and
requires every variable in `.env.example`. Keep real credentials private.
The template values allow the skeleton to start; they do not configure cloud
resources. Replace Cognito placeholders and the flag secret before those
features are implemented. MongoDB and Cognito are not contacted yet.

Visit `http://localhost:4000/api/health` for `{ "status": "ok", "replica": "<hostname>" }`.
Run `npm test` in `backend/` for API and environment validation tests, or
`npm start` to run without nodemon. Removing `MONGODB_URI` from the environment
and `.env` makes startup exit with code 1 and an error naming the variable.

The folder placeholders contain no frontend, challenge, Nginx, or deployment
implementation. Auth, teams, database connectivity, and seed data are later
tasks. `npm run seed` currently exits with a P1-14 reminder.
GitHub branch protection and collaborator access still need verification for P1-01.

Dependency reasons: Express handles HTTP; Helmet adds security headers;
Zod validates configuration and future requests; dotenv loads local settings;
Mongoose and aws-jwt-verify are the requested foundations for later database
and Cognito work. Vitest runs tests, Supertest exercises HTTP, and nodemon
restarts the development server.

## Whole stack (requires later tasks)

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # fill in Atlas + Cognito values
docker compose up --build   # starts nginx + 3 backend replicas
```

Open http://localhost and log in.
